    <p><strong>A World. Not a Website.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Welcome to the official world of <strong>Tez Da Queen</strong> — a living, breathing archive of experience, perspective, and divine timing.
    </p>

    <p>This is a portal.<br>A space that exists intentionally.</p>

    <p>Some things are meant to be shared.<br>Some things are meant to be accessed.</p>

    <h2>✨ Home</h2>

    <p><strong>Bold. Magnetic. Ever Evolving.</strong></p>

    <p>
      Tez Da Queen is not a brand built on trends — she is a presence shaped by lived experience, intuition, and ancestral knowledge.
      This world documents travel, fashion, business, spirituality, <strong>natural remedies, herbalism</strong>, and the people,
      places, and ideas that pass through her orbit. Tez is also an <strong>Herbalist</strong>, rooted in plant intelligence,
      holistic healing, and natural remedies passed through experience and study.
    </p>

    <p>You didn’t arrive here by accident.</p>
    <p><strong>Divine timing brought you.</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      “Anything you feed enough energy to will have power.”<br>

    <h3>🔔 Access</h3>

    <p>This world is intentional. So is the energy required to enter it.</p>

    <p><strong>Access is $5</strong></p>

    <p>An energetic exchange to unlock a private, evolving space.</p>

    <h2>🌙 About Tez</h2>

    <p>
      I am also an <strong>Herbalist</strong> — honoring plant medicine, natural remedies, and holistic practices
      as tools for healing, balance, and self-reclamation.
    </p>

    <p>I am <strong>Tez Da Queen</strong>.</p>

    <p>A divine being walking in her purpose.</p>

    <p>Unorthodox by nature. Grounded in intuition. Moving in divine timing.</p>

    <p>
      I was <strong>raised in Merritt Island, Florida</strong>, but shaped by a lifetime of traveling the world.
      My perspective has been formed through movement, observation, conversation, and experience — not theory.
    </p>

    <p>This world focuses on <strong>all things Tez Da Queen</strong> — her vision, her values, her world.</p>

    <p>And all things Tez Da Queen means:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Travel as lived experience</li>
      <li>Fashion as expression</li>
      <li>Business as discernment</li>
      <li>Spirituality as self-knowledge</li>
      <li>Herbalism and natural remedies as ancestral wisdom</li>
      <li>Community as currency</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It also means highlighting and promoting:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Businesses I personally vouch for</li>
      <li>Restaurants and spaces I stand behind</li>
      <li>Ideas I believe are powerful</li>
      <li>People within our collective who are aligned</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is raw. Uncut. And ever evolving.</p>
